# StreamDeck

## The idea

I'm not streaming anymore and my StreamDeck was taking the dust. So why not using it in my workflow or try to.

## The plugins needed

[Stream Deck for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nicollasr.vscode-streamdeck) made by [Nicollas Ricas](https://github.com/nicollasricas/vscode-deck/releases/tag/4.1.5).

[The Stream Deck plugin](https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/visual-studio-code-61254b24-a60c-4a87-acae-70c39eda8a19) also made by **Nicollas Ricas**.

> [Elgato Key Creator](https://www.elgato.com/fr/fr/s/keycreator) is the generator I used to personnalize each button.
> 
> [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) has been used for the free svg logos.

## The goals

Produce more code and faster.

Sometimes I forget some snippets I have in my VSCode settings, it helps.

The terminal commands are pretty useful, I don't like to press `Ctrl+C` two times to shut my server.

I decided to change all the default logos for something more aesthetic and visual.

## See ya' !
